  <body>
    <p>Dear Noam Dahan and Yvgeni Naumov,</p>
    <p>I hope you're doing well.<br>
    I'm reaching out with a matter that requires your immediate attention.<br>
    It has come to my attention that a photo of both of you currently circulating on SolarEdge's social media; and is becoming a subject of concern within the company.<br>
    Given the nature of the image, I thought it was important to let you know, as it might reflect negatively on your public image.<br>
    Iâ€™ll be blunt: the image is disturbing to some of our clients.<br>
    Especially, the German clients...</p>

    <p>Here is the offending image:</p>
    <img src="cid:image1" alt="Inappropriate Photo">

    <p>I would recommend removing the photo at your earliest convenience to avoid any potential issues.</p>

    <p>If you'd like to discuss this further or need assistance, feel free to reach out.</p>
    
    <p>Sincerely,<br>
    Rachel Prishkolnik<br>
    VP General Counsel and Corporate Secretary<br>
    Solaredge Technologies</p>
